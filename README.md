# Let Him Cook

## About The Game

"Let Him Cook" is a comedic and quirky cooking simulation game born from the creative minds of a four-person team during a 48-hour game jam. With limited prior experience in Unity scripting, our team embraced the game jam theme of 'Anachronism' to craft a unique experience that blends prehistoric settings with timeless humor.

### The Premise

You step into the stone shoes of Hemmi, a caveman whose evolutionary journey is humorously incomplete. Tasked with cooking a meal using ingredients and tools that transcend time, players guide Hemmi in his quest to whip up the best dish possible.

### Gameplay

- Guide Hemmi using your mouse through an anachronistic kitchen.
- Grab ingredients with a left click and drop them into the bowl on the right to start cooking.
- Watch as Hemmi takes on the fearless task of eating whatever comes out of the bowl, facing whatever consequences that follow.

### A Note on Controls

The controls are deliberately unreliable and challenging—after all, you're controlling a caveman! Should Hemmi's arm get stuck, a little wiggle and flail should set things right. It's all part of the fun and games!
